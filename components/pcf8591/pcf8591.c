/*************************************************************************

NXP PCF8591 control code.
This chip is an 8 bit A/D converter with 4 channels and D/A converter with 1 channel.
It is read via I2C bus (max freq is 100 kHz)
We use it in single-ended mode (4 input channels). 
Reference voltage for ADC is a 3.3V precision voltage regulator: NCP5146, 1% accuracy
